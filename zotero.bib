  abstract = {Roman archaeology has long made use of an urban-rural dichotomy to conceptualize and frame questions about the material record, carrying over values of urbanism and rusticity explicit in ancient textual sources. The construction of rural culture deserves articulation not as a received idea, but through comparison of actual assemblages recovered from archaeological contexts in the countryside. Accordingly, this paper uses the small finds from the Roman Peasant Project (2009-2014), a project to study the lives of the ancient inhabitants of the comune of Cinigiano (GR), to investigate behavioral patterns at seven sites in south-central Tuscany. I utilize a computational approach which automates the process of interpreting finds as indices of different behaviors and I compare the socioeconomic landscape of this rural community in two broad periods, the late Republican / Julio-Claudian and Late Antique. I show not only that a formal, quantitative approach to the categorization of finds and comparison of site functionality can be used to measure overall variability in each period, but also that it is possible to assess the behavioral factors that lay behind the makeup of the Roman rural economy in this region. In the earlier period, peasants' lives were distinguished by lower levels of coin circulation and greater variability in site investment, although with a more homogenous lifestyle. In Late Antiquity, craft production and coin-based exchange were much more diffuse throughout society, perhaps indicating diminishing networks of long-term reciprocity and interdependency among different communities as local production and cash transactions became more common.},

Not least, suburban amphitheaters took advantage of the zone's open space to manage large festival crowds that included locals as well as the residents of neighboring cities. At the same time, the Italian highway system brought many regional and long-distance travelers to the suburbs, making a suburban amphitheater a particularly effective means of communicating competition with neighboring cities while at the same time expressing participation in a larger shared culture. Nearby monumental tombs, moreover, reinforced an amphitheater's message, enhancing the urban fa\c{c}ade while celebrating the city's most prominent residents. In some cases, this interaction could even recall the architecture of the capital and declare a local endorsement of imperial power.},

  abstract = {Defined by borders both physical and conceptual, the Roman city stood apart as a concentration of life and activity that was legally, economically, and ritually divided from its rural surroundings. Death was a key area of control, and tombs were relegated outside city walls from the Republican period through Late Antiquity. Given this separation, an unexpected phenomenon marked the Augustan and early Imperial periods: Roman cities developed suburbs, built-up areas beyond their boundaries, where the living and the dead came together in densely urban environments. Life and Death in the Roman Suburb examines these districts, drawing on the archaeological remains of cities across Italy to understand the character of Roman suburbs and to illuminate the factors that led to their rise and decline, focusing especially on the tombs of the dead. Whereas work on Roman cities has tended to pass over funerary material, and research on death has concentrated on issues seen as separate from urbanism, Emmerson introduces a new paradigm, considering tombs within their suburban surroundings of shops, houses, workshops, garbage dumps, extramural sanctuaries, and major entertainment buildings, in order to trace the many roles they played within living cities. Her investigations show how tombs were not passive memorials, but active spaces that facilitated and furthered the social and economic life of the city, where relationships between the living and the dead were an enduring aspect of urban life--Jacket},

Previous studies have tried to explain the attraction of the arena by theorizing about its cultural function in Roman society. The games have been seen as celebrations of the violence of empire or of Rome's martial heritage, or as manifestations of the emperor's power. The desire to watch has therefore been limited to the Roman context and rendered alien to modern sensibilities. Yet the historical record reveals that people living in quite different times and circumstances (including our own) have regularly come out in large numbers to watch public rituals of violence such as executions, floggings, animal-baiting, cudgeling, pugilism, and so on. Appreciating the social-psychological dynamics at work in attracting people to watch such events not only deepens our understanding of the spectator at the Roman games but also suggests something important about ourselves."},

Its study forms part of the British School at Rome's Tiber Valley Project, a collaborative research initiative which studies the Tiber valley as the hinterland of Rome, tracing the impact of Rome's development on the history of its settlement, economy, and cultural identity from 1000 B.C. to A.D. 1300 (Patterson and Millett 1999; Patterson et al. 2000) (fig. 1). The project draws on the extensive work carried out in this area to produce a new, material-based history of the valley. While the project seeks to re-evaluate past survey material, a vital contrast is provided by the development of new field projects to fill the gaps in settlement knowledge. Three main lacunae have been identified: the study of urban centres; the dearth of data from the E bank of the Tiber; and the poor understanding of the late-antique and early Mediaeval landscape. Forum Novum offers an opportunity to address all these lacunae.             Urbanism forms a key research theme for the Tiber Valley Project. In marked contrast to the intensity of archaeological work on rural settlement in this area, there has been little systematic research on towns. Study has tended to concentrate on the excavation of monumental structures or, more rarely, the investigation of single and exceptional towns such as Ostia and Rome itself. Surprisingly little is known of the organization of the smaller towns and knowledge of their history is based largely on the epigraphic and documentary evidence.},

The work forms part of the British School at Rome's Tiber Valley Project, which studies the changing landscapes of the middle Tiber valley as the hinterland of Rome through two millennia, from 1000 BC to AD 1000. At Forum Novum a range of remote sensing techniques are being combined with excavation to examine the extent and organization of a Roman town and its development through time. From 1997 to 2001 a series of topographic and high-resolution ground-based remote sensing surveys took place at Forum Novum, which provide a basic map of the ancient centre. The integrated remote sensing surveys were carried out using the magnetic, geoelectric and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods. The analysis of the gradiometric, resistivity and GPR time-slice maps indicate that many structural foundations and walls of the buildings are still well preserved below the surface. The results, which are presented and discussed in this paper, demonstrate the potential of remote sensing techniques for our understanding of the extent and organization of urban centres. In the case of Forum Novum, where much of the ancient centre lies under modern structures, GPR survey, in particular, proved fundamental. Further, the results of the georadar surveys permitted archaeologists to select key areas of the town for more detailed investigation through excavation.

  abstract = {Since the widespread adoption of GIS by archaeologists in the early 1990s, analyses of visibility have steadily gained traction, becoming commonplace in landscape and regional analysis. This is in large part due to the routine way in which such products can be generated, bolstered by a raft of landscape-based studies that have placed varying degrees of emphasis upon human perception and direct bodily engagement in seeking to understand and explore the past. Despite this seeming popularity, two worrying trends stand out. The first is the lack of any coherent theoretical framework, applications preferring instead to seek justification in the very first wave of experiential landscape approaches that emerged in the early 1990s. Needless to say, the intervening 20 or so years have seen considerable development in the conceptual tools we draw upon in order to make sense of past landscapes, not to mention considerable finessing of the first-wave developments alluded to above. Second is the tendency to relegate viewshed analysis to certain types of predictable problem or question (i.e. viewshed analysis has become typecast). These trends have been compounded by a host of other issues. For example, whilst there have been refinements, tweaks and variations to the basic viewshed (and the frequency with which they are generated and combined), not to mention establishment of robust calibration criteria for controlling them and statistical approaches for assessing the patterns tendered, these have yet to be brought together in any coherent fashion and their veracity critically assessed. Likewise, a failure to establish an agreed vocabulary has resulted in a number of proverbial wheels being reinvented time and again. The argument presented here is that viewsheds have considerably more to offer archaeology but to realise this entails confronting these issues head on. That this is possible and desirable is illustrated through discussion of a new theoretical framework for visibility-studies that draws upon developments in assemblage theory and the author's own work on affordance and relationality. To demonstrate the value of this approach in encouraging different ways of thinking about what viewsheds are and how we might begin to draw creatively upon them, a case-study is described where viewsheds are folded into a detailed exploration of landscape liminality.},

  abstract = {While much depends on the definition of the term and the extent to which that accommodates variability, the number of currently known Roman amphitheaters can be put between 260 and 280. By both rough calculation assuming a typical capacity of 11,000 and by taking account of prior scholarship when possible to use individual capacities for each structure, the total estimated seating capacity of all Roman amphitheaters is approximately three million. That is a large number in the context of an ancient state such as the Roman empire. For amphitheaters for which no estimate of capacity is available, this article uses Nearest Neighbors estimation to impute a capacity on the basis of known dimensions. Doing so accommodates the observation that the seating capacity of any amphitheater was not zero so that a number must be calculated. All the data by which these calculations are made - along with the Python code - are available for download and adaptation so that the process used here is reproducible. With an estimated total having been calculated, the distribution of these seats is explored as grouped by modern countries and ancient regions. The distribution is also mapped. These visualizations highlight Italy, and particularly Campania, as the area of greatest concentration of amphitheater seating. Africa Proconsularis is also an area of concentrated seating. The main goal of this article is to report the three million total estimated seating capacity and to visualize and map its spatial distribution. The article does also suggest that while amphitheaters can be considered important symbols of Roman culture, the unequal distribution of seating suggests unequal access to the experience of watching violent entertainments in these buildings. By offering a relatively straightforward approach to calculating its results, it also intends to be an easy point of reference for scholars integrating amphitheaters and their seating into historical narratives that take account of such issues as the chronology of individual buildings to the extent that can be known.},

  abstract = {An important and frequently used tool in archaeological spatial analysis is least-cost path (LCP) analysis to compute routes connecting a set of targets. The outcome depends on the cost model chosen and the topographic data used. A slope-dependent cost model requires a digital elevation model (DEM) that should reflect the landscape in the past. It is often impossible to reconstruct the past terrain, and modern high-resolution elevation data results in problematic storage requirements and computation times. This article presents a case study that explores issues in replication and stability of LCP calculations for pairs of targets that are close to known old trade routes. A large number of cost models is tested based on two topographic data sets, including DEMs of two different resolutions (25 m and 50 m). The cost models use six different slope-dependent cost functions suggested by various authors for pedestrian movement. Moreover, a slope-dependent cost function is applied that results in LCPs including hairpin curves if the slope exceeds a predefined critical value. It is shown that the best-performing LCP sets for the two topographic data sets are closely related but not identical. Moreover, reasons for the failure of LCP reconstructions for some old route sections are discussed.},

  abstract = {Each model of past movement based on historical and archaeological evidence nowadays relies implicitly or explicitly on a cost function estimating costs of movement in terms of time, calories or some other currency for the study area and period of time considered. Cost functions are the basis of two popular GIS-based areas of spatial analysis in archaeology: site catchments and least-cost paths. A site catchment is the region accessible from a site, and often archaeological studies analyse the resources within this region. A least-cost path (LCP) is the route minimizing the costs of movement between two given locations. In archaeological studies, the aim of LCP calculations is often to reconstruct ancient routes or a route network or to identify the principal factors governing the construction of known roads or road segments. For generating a site catchment, GIS programs compute an accumulated cost surface (ACS). This is also the first step for LCP generation; therefore, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented in most GIS programs for this purpose is outlined. The cost function applied for calculating the ACS typically depends on slope, soil type, vegetation cover or the presence of streams. Several slope-dependent cost functions and a list of terrain factors are presented. Moreover, issues with least-cost applications are discussed, including barrier implementation, restricted number of possible movement directions, and the calculation of slope-based costs for a path taken in one or two directions. The aim of the case study is to compare the site catchments of a Roman farm and a temple at different scales based on a cost model derived from Roman roads. The concluding section discusses validation and stability of the outcomes of the methods presented and some additional issues such as modelling movement beyond walking. Finally, some other cost function based approaches are outlined.},

Analysis of a funerary altar from early imperial Rome alongside larger bodies of legal and epigraphic evidence shows that in this transactional mode of manumission, enslaved women paid for their freedom by foregoing certain privileges, including, to varying degrees, the ability to enter and exit the marriage at will and the separation of their property from that of their husbands. Through a close examination of one mode of manumission and the unequal unions that resulted from it, this paper offers further evidence that freedom was not uniform, but varied in its meaning depending on who achieved it and by what means.},

Boundaries of status rather than of geopolitics were those difficult to cross. The book discusses the stories of individuals and migrant groups, traders, refugees, expulsions, the founding and demolition of sites, and the political processes that could both encourage and discourage the transfer of people from one place to another. In so doing it highlights moments of change in the concepts of mobility and the definitions of those on the move.

  abstract = {The movement of past peoples in the landscape has been studied extensively through the use of least cost path (LCP) analysis. Although methodological issues of applying LCP analysis in archaeology have frequently been discussed, the effect of DEM error on LCP results has not been fully assessed. Due to this, the reliability of the LCP result is undermined, jeopardising how well the method can confidently be used to model past movement. To strengthen the reliability of LCP results, this research proposes the use of Monte Carlo simulation as a method for incorporating and propagating the effects of error on LCP results. Focusing on vertical error, random error fields are calculated and incorporated into the documented and reproducible LCP modelling process using the R package leastcostpath. By graphically communicating the impact of vertical error using probabilistic LCPs, uncertainty in the results can be taken into account when interpreting LCPs. The method is applied to a Roman road case study, finding that the incorporation of vertical error results in the identification of multiple `least cost' routes within the landscape. Furthermore, the deviation between the roman road and the probabilistic LCP suggests that the location of the roman road was influenced by additional factors other than minimising energy expenditure. This research finds that the probabilistic LCP derived using Monte Carlo simulation is a viable method for the graphical communication of the uncertainty caused by error within the input data used within the LCP modelling process. Therefore, it is recommended that probabilistic LCPs become the default approach when modelling movement using input data that contains errors.},

When the political situation stabilized around 600 CE, Rome and Ravenna, still under East Roman control, were linked by a thin tendril of territory encapsulating a militarized travel zone between the two cities, the ``Byzantine Corridor.'' This study uses GIS analysis, particularly least-cost path techniques, to provide further perspectives on how communication was managed between Rome and Ravenna. This technique forms the basis of a movement model in order to calculate some approximate travel times between the two cities. Having some sense of the speed and ease at which the two cities could communicate with each other creates a baseline on which to understand how decisions of political importance were made and how the geographies of communication were reconfigured in late antique and early medieval Italy.},

Martinori's monograph on the Via Cassia (and Clodia) is little more than a compilation of facts about the places along its presumed route; and Lopes Pegna's recent articles, though a useful contribution, are concerned rather with the problems raised by the study of the Classical itineraries than with their topographical implications. And yet for two millennia these roads have played a major, often a determining, part in the history of the regions through which they pass They have become a part of the essential pattern of life, and it is perhaps for that very reason that they have so often been taken for granted.},

This data can be used to improve research about the preservation and visibility of the archaeological record, and it can also aid heritage management. This paper presents a composite Image-Based Modelling workflow to generate 3D models, historical orthophotos, and historical digital elevation models from images from the 1970s. This was done to improve the interpretation of survey data from the early Roman colony of Aesernia. The main challenge was the lack of high-resolution recent digital elevation models and ground control points, and a general lack of metadata. Therefore, spatial data from various sources had to be combined. To assess the accuracy of the final 3D model, the RMSE was calculated. While the workflow appears effective, the low accuracy of the initial data limits the usefulness of the model for the study of geomorphological change. However, it can be implemented to aid sample area selection when preparing archaeological fieldwork. Additionally, when working with existing survey datasets, areas with a high bias risk resulting from post-depositional processes can be indicated.},

  abstract = {Due to the proliferation of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and the improvement of graphic user interfaces, least-cost analysis has become one of the most common tools in archaeological research for modelling movement across past landscapes. While more complex techniques and algorithms have been developed to address the theoretical limitations of least-cost analysis, many of these are not readily accessible to typical GIS users, due to either hardware limitations or a lack of in-depth training in the theory and methods of spatial analysis. Seeking a middle ground, we test a number of simple modifications to basic least-cost analysis using the Mani peninsula in southern Greece as a case study. We assess eight procedures for calculating least-cost paths (LCPs), defining cost based on a combination of slope and the location of pre-modern pathways. These procedures are used to generate LCPs for a well-documented journey made by Colonel William Martin Leake in the year 1805. Comparing the LCPs against Leake's detailed notes and ``low-cost corridors,'' we visually assess the reliability of each model and identify likely alternative routes. We conclude that a simple modification to basic least-cost analysis \textendash{} incorporating a time-based algorithm along with traces of pre-modern footpaths and roads \textendash{} can produce robust, reliable least-cost models in other archaeological contexts where traces of pre-modern pathways can still be detected.},

Informed by disability studies, this article analyses the architecture of public spaces and facilities, alongside epigraphic, iconographic and literary evidence, to argue that the ancient Greeks sought to ensure the accessibility of healing sanctuaries. Even without a framework of civil rights as we understand them today, the builders of these sites made architectural choices that enabled individuals with impaired mobility to access these spaces. It is hoped that this research may stimulate further investigations into accessibility at other sites in the Classical world and beyond.},

  abstract = {This paper explores reciprocal relationships between landscape, human attention, and time. I present two sacred landscapes: Epidaurus and Nemea, located in Greece's northeastern Peloponnese. In both landscapes, worshipers created sanctuaries on prominent mountains. Eventually, their attention shifted downhill where they built larger, monumental sanctuaries on the flat ground. I trace each mountain's role as a sacred landmark; I question what other social functions they had \textendash{} if at all \textendash{} after the new sanctuaries were built. I consider a wide range of evidence. I begin with a comparative example from Mount Fuji in Japan, and move on to archaeological excavation and survey data, ancient testimonials, and modern tourist reviews about the Greek sanctuaries. I also use Geographic Information Systems to quantify each Greek sanctuary's visual impact in comparison to the surrounding topography. Woven together, these data reveal generations of sacral continuity. The Sanctuary of Asklepios and the Sanctuary of Zeus encircled new sacred temenoi, but worshipers' collective memory guided their pathways and vision; through human senses, these mountains retained their role as sacred landmarks.}

  abstract = {Archaeologists have long acknowledged the significance of mountains in siting Greek cult. Mountains were where the gods preferred to make contact and there people constructed sanctuaries to inspire intervention. Greece is a land full of mountains, but we lack insight on the ancient Greeks' view\textemdash what visible and topographic characteristics made particular mountains ideal places for worship over others, and whether worshiper preferences ever changed. This article describes a data collection and analysis methodology for landscapes where visualscape was a significant factor in situating culturally significant activities. Using a big-data approach, four geospatial analyses are applied to every cultic place in the Peloponnesian regions of the Argolid and Messenia, spanning 2800\textendash 146 BC. The fully described methodology combines a number of experiences\textemdash looking out, looking toward, and climbing up\textemdash and measures how these change through time. The result is an active historic model of Greek religious landscape, describing how individuals moved, saw, and integrated the built and natural world in different ways. Applied elsewhere, and even on nonreligious locales, this is a replicable mode for treating the natural landscape as an artifact of human decision: as a space impacting the siting of meaningful locales through history., Alrededor del mundo, las monta\~nas provocan la creaci\'on de lugares religiosos en el paisaje como resultado de sus efectos visuales; los adoradores se inspiran en las cuencas de las monta\~nas y su prominencia f\'isica. Los arque\'ologos debaten c\'omo mejor modelar este proceso: si a trav\'es de enfoques geoespaciales o fenomenol\'ogicos, o la integraci\'on de los dos. Las metodolog\'ias detalladas que involucran m\'ultiples enfoques y grandes conjuntos de datos son raras. Este documento proporciona un marco detallado para integrar an\'alisis geoespaciales precisos con la recopilaci\'on de datos fenomenol\'ogicos, con el fin de determinar qu\'e caracter\'isticas topogr\'aficas y visuales configuraron los paisajes religiosos. Presenta un estudio de caso sobre las regiones del Peloponeso de Arg\'olida y Mesenia, y explora lugares de culto (es decir, religiosos) utilizados por los griegos entre el 2,800 y 146 aC. Esta metodolog\'ia, completamente descrita en esta ponencia, combina varias experiencias (observaci\'on general, observaci\'on hacia el objeto, y la escalada en s\'i) y compara las preferencias cambiantes a lo largo del tiempo. El resultado es un modelo din\'amico del paisaje religioso griego, que articula la movilidad de los antiguos griegos, y de c\'omo estos vieron e integraron de manera diferente el mundo construido y natural a lo largo del tiempo. Aplicado en otros lugares, e incluso en lugares no religiosos, este es un modo replicable para tratar el paisaje natural como un artefacto de la decisi\'on humana: como un espacio que impacta la ubicaci\'on de lugares significativos a lo largo de la historia.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) is changing our viewpoint towards Earth surface landforms. Nevertheless, large-coverage, intermediate-resolution DEMs are still largely used, and can be the ideal choice in several applications based on the processing of spatially-integrated information. In 2012 the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia opened a website for the free download of the ``TINTALY'' Digital Elevation Model (DEM), which covers the whole Italian territory. Since then, about 700 users from 28 different countries have been accredited for data download, and a report of 4years of data dissemination and use is presented. The analysis of the intended use reveals that the 10m-resolution, seamless TINITALY DEM is of use for an extremely assorted research community. Accredited users are working in virtually any branch of the Earth Sciences (e.g. Volcanology, Seismology, and Geomorphology), in spatially integrated humanities (e.g. History and Archaeology), and in other thematic areas such as in applied Physics and Zoology. Many users are also working in local administrations (e.g. Regions and Municipalities) for civil protection or land use planning purposes. In summary, the documented activity shows that the dissemination of seamless, large coverage elevation datasets can fertilize the technological progress of the whole society providing a significant benefit to stakeholders.},

L'indagine di superficie rimane legata ad un limitato range di domande guidate da testi e domande `processuali', ed \`e isolata da un pi\`u ampio pensiero archeologico circa la cultura materiale e il paesaggio. In forte contrasto con altre regioni e periodi, lo studio del paesaggio romano d'Italia continua a focalizzarsi sui siti, sulla ceramica e sui processi, piuttosto che sui luoghi, la gente e le idee. lo auspico un cambiamento epistemologico per portare gli studi verso un dialogo con la piu ampia disciplina. A questo scopo vengono sottoposte a critica pratiche teoretiche e metodologiche. La convinzione che la ricognizione \`e incapace di rispondere a questioni come l'identit\`a sociale viene abbandonata attraverso una `decostruzione' di come la conoscenza archeologica viene costruita. Una serie di potenziali soggetti di ricerca vengono discusse al fine di delineare una nuova agenda per le ricognizioni in Italia. Il fine \`e quello di stimolare una diversificazione degli approcci che realizzino pienamente il potenziale informativo della ricognizione come contributo alla studio dei paesaggi romani.},

Consideration of methodological issues of survey comparison suggests the problem is real, but not insuperable. A range of interpretative models is discussed with particular reference to the impact of the Urbs on economic, agricultural, and social developments. The structural connections between these sub-regions are emphasized, particularly the organization of labour, demography, and agricultural strategies. The results reveal varied responses to Roman control, leading to more not less diversity. More generally, the results underline the value of comparing regional survey data.},
